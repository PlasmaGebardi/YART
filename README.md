# YART
Yet Another React Typescript repo

There are thousands of simple react applications and typescript baseline projects on github/internet, but here we try to be concise and as simple as possible.

Its always good idea to reinvent the wheel.

TODO:
 - Super simple application that can be cleanly converted to typescript usage
 - Necessary steps that are simple enough that this could be used as a tutorial (reminder)
 - "Proper" project structure that allows different kinds of environmental tweaking
 - Everything should be easily (re-)runnable via simple scripts
